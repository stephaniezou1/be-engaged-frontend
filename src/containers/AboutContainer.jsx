                        Sadly, partisan bickering has cast a shadow of doubt over the legitimacy of voting by mail as an alternative to voting in person. For this reason, I want to reassure you that voting by mail is a secure and established part of our American electoral system that has long been supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.

                    Even if you think youâ€™re registered, double-check! Sometimes names get removed by mistake, or by people who are afraid of what happens if you vote.
